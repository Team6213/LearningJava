# LearningJava
Contains 9 assignments for teaching future programmers Java

# Welcome to Team 6213!
To paraphrase Chef Gusteau (Ratatouille, 2007): “Anyone can code”. All that you need is determination, and an open mind
Programming usually has a steep learning curve, so do not become discouraged if some of the assignments take a while
After the completion of these assignments, you will be more than ready to tackle programming the robot, and be prepared
to continue learning about programming

# Notes
These are assignments mirroring those in a college intro to programming course
Be prepared to spend time going through the material and doing the work

This "course" will be paced at about 1 chapter per week. 
Between each meeting you should read the chapter(s) and attempt the lab
Feel free to ask James any questions

# Getting Started
- Install Java and JDK
- Install Eclipse
- How to do the projects

# Textbook
A PDF copy of a useful textbook is provided in this repository
Before attempting a lab, read through the specified chapters 
it is recommended to take basic notes for future study

# Labs
At some point I will add in a program to each lab which will test your creations.
Until then, I will check them myself
Copy/Paste your project into the Work folder for each lab, or create/open it there
